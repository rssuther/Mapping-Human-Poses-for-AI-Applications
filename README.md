# Mapping Human Posesf for AI Applications

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to produce a body-motion tracking and recognition system that enables movements of the human body to be identified. The system will describe extensively and completely the motion of the human body in a notation that will be passed into a machine learning model to recognize various motions and poses. These poses will then be labeled and identified by the system to relay useful information about the motion. For example, with ground traffic control signals at the airport, the system could recognize the particular directives of the ground crew, and relay this information to the pilot or planes computer system.

Our goal is to visually identify and track human poses and movements. These identifications will be used to relay useful information about human signals to someone who is out of viewing range. We are looking to use Microsoft’s Azure Kinect to achieve our goal because it has great documentation, as well as compatibility with our hardware.

### Minimum host PC hardware requirements
The PC host hardware requirement is dependent on application/algorithm/sensor frame rate/resolution executed on host PC. Recommended minimum Sensor SDK configuration for Windows is:
  
  ```
  - Seventh Gen Intel® CoreTM i3 Processor (Dual Core 2.4 GHz with HD620 GPU or faster)
  
  - 4 GB Memory
  
  - Dedicated USB3 port
  
  - Graphics driver support for OpenGL 4.4 or DirectX 11.0
  
  - Lower end or older CPUs may also work depending on your use-case.
  ```
  
Performance differs also between Windows/Linux operating systems and graphics drivers in use.

### Body tracking host PC hardware requirements
The body tracking PC host requirement is more stringent than the general PC host requirement. Recommended minimum Body Tracking SDK configuration for Windows is:
  
  ```
  - Seventh Gen Intel® CoreTM i5 Processor (Quad Core 2.4 GHz or faster)
  
  - 4 GB Memory
  
  - NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070 or better
  
  - Dedicated USB3 port
  ```
