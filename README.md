# Mapping-Human-poses-for-AI-applications

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to produce a body-motion tracking and recognition system that enables movements of the human body to be identified. The system will describe extensively and completely the motion of the human body in a notation that will be passed into a machine learning model to recognize various motions and poses. These poses will then be labeled and identified by the system to relay useful information about the motion. For example, with ground traffic control signals at the airport, the system could recognize the particular directives of the ground crew, and relay this information to the pilot or planes computer system.

Our goal is to visually identify and track human poses and movements. These identifications will be used to relay useful information about human signals to someone who is out of viewing range. We are looking to use Microsoftâ€™s Azure Kinect to achieve our goal because it has great documentation, as well as compatibility with our hardware.
